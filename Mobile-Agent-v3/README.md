## Introduction
GUI-Owl is a model series developed as part of the Mobile-Agent-v3 project. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of GUI automation benchmarks, including ScreenSpot-v2, ScreenSpot-Pro, OSWorld-G, MMBench-GUI, Android Control, Android World, and OSWorld. Furthermore, it can be instantiated as various specialized agents within the Mobile-Agent-v3 multi-agent framework to accomplish more complex tasks.

## Deploy Mobile-Agent-v3 on your mobile device.
‚ùóAt present, only **Android OS** and **Harmony OS** (version <= 4) support tool debugging. Other systems, such as **iOS**, do not support the use of Mobile-Agent for the time being.

### Install the dependencies required by the qwen model.
```
pip install qwen_agent
pip install qwen_vl_utils
```

### Preparation for Connecting Mobile Device with ADB
1. Download the [Android Debug Bridge](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools?hl=en).
2. Turn on the ADB debugging switch on your Android phone, it needs to be turned on in the developer options first. If it is the HyperOS system, you need to turn on USB Debugging (Security Settings) at the same time.
3. Connect your phone to the computer with a data cable and select "Transfer files".
4. Test your ADB environment as follow: ```/path/to/adb devices```. If the connected devices are displayed, the preparation is complete.
5. If you are using a MAC or Linux system, make sure to turn on adb permissions as follow: ```sudo chmod +x /path/to/adb```
6. If you are using Windows system, the path will be ```xx/xx/adb.exe```

### Install the ADB Keyboard on your Mobile Device
1. Download the ADB keyboard [apk](https://github.com/senzhk/ADBKeyBoard/blob/master/ADBKeyboard.apk) installation package.
2. Click the apk to install on your mobile device.
3. Switch the default input method in the system settings to "ADB Keyboard".

### Run
```
cd Mobile-Agent-v3/mobile_v3
python run_mobileagentv3.py \
    --adb_path "Your ADB path" \
    --api_key "Your api key of vllm service" \
    --base_url "Your base url of vllm service" \
    --model "Your model name of vllm service" \
    --instruction "The instruction you want Mobile-Agent-v3 to complete" \
    --add_info "Some supplementary knowledge, can also be empty"
```

### Note
1. If the model you are using outputs relative coordinates from 0 to 1000, such as Seed-VL or Qwen-2.5-VL, please set:
```
--coor_type "qwen-vl"
```

2. If your instruction needs to remember content, please set:
```
--notetaker True
```

## Evaluation on AndroidWorld
1. Please follow the [official code repository](https://github.com/google-research/android_world?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) to install the Android emulator and necessary dependencies.

2. Install the dependencies required by the qwen model.
```
pip install qwen_agent
pip install qwen_vl_utils
```

3. Fill in your vllm service information in the `run_guiowl.sh` or `run_ma3.sh` script, including api_key, base_url, and model.

4. Run the evaluation.
```
cd MobileAgent/Mobile-Agent-v3/androld_world_v3
sh run_guiowl.sh
sh run_ma3.sh
```

5. We provide evaluation trajectory and logs for viewing.
